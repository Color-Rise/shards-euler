# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

Link to the problem: [https://projecteuler.net/problem=2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2).

!!! quote "Problem 2"
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## A simple solution

A straightfoward implementation would look like this.

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    --8<-- "src/problems/problem-002a.edn"
    ```


=== "Output"

    ```
    --8<-- "src/problems/problem-002a.edn.log"
    ```

## A better solution

We can get rid of the testing of even values: since the first two numbers of the sequence are odd, it is easy to see that only every third number is even:

```
1  1  2  3  5  8 13 21 34
o  o  e  o  o  e  o  o  e
```

In other words, we can calculate the next 3 numbers during a single iteration and only sum that last one (which is even).

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    --8<-- "src/problems/problem-002b.edn"
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    --8<-- "src/problems/problem-002b.edn.log"
    ```
