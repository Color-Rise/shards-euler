# Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

!!! quote "Problem 12"

    The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7^th^ triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$.
    
    The first ten terms would be $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...$

    Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
    ```
     1: 1
     3: 1,3
     6: 1,2,3,6
    10: 1,2,5,10
    15: 1,3,5,15
    21: 1,3,7,21
    28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
    ```

    We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

    What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## A simple solution

Let's call our triangle number $t$. A brute force solution might look like this:

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    --8<-- "src/problems/problem-012a.edn"
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    [info] [...] [main-chain] Answer: 76576500
    ```

## A better and faster solution

As expected, the above solution is **extremely** slow.

It can be improved when considering that for every divisor up to the square root, there is by construction a corresponding
divisor above it. In other words, we can count the number of divisors up to $\sqrt{t}$ and double that number (unless the last 
divisor is exactly $\sqrt{t}$, in which case we only count it once).

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    --8<-- "src/problems/problem-012b.edn"
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    [info] [...] [main-chain] Answer: 76576500
    ```
