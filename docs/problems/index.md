# Introduction to the problems

The problems come from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each of the problem contains the full source of the one or several solutions. To try them out, copy the content into a file `solution.edn` and run the following command:

=== "Windows"

    ```
    .\shards.exe solution.edn
    ```

=== "Unix"

    ```
    ./shards solution.edn
    ```

`shards` is the executable which can be [built from the sources](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/contribute/code/building-shards/).
